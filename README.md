## Project Overview


**Background**
This project aims to create a PDB board for a variable stereo vision camera rig consisting of many motors and a raspberry pi and usb cameras. Stereo vision is a technique that utilizes multiple viewpoints (cameras) and their 2d projections to obtain 3d images information about the scene. However, there is one problem with this approach: the distance between the cameras (baseline) has a significant impact on the range the technique is effective. So to overcome these challenges, the end goal is to create a rig, where the baseline can be adjusted on the fly.


**PDB**
Many powered components in the projects necessitate the presence of a proper power delivery system, via a power distribution board(PDB). The point of the board is to provide a central hub through which all components can get power in a safe and consistent manner. The board is responsible for turning Vbat (~22.4V) into ranges that other components on the rig can accept (5V for PI, 12V Motors, 3.3V for misc sensor), and preventing short circuits with some form of overcurrent protection or fuses.


## Educational Value Added
The educational value of this project comes from gaining practical experience in the full lifecycle of designing a robust power distribution board. It reinforces understanding of power electronics, voltage regulation, and high-current circuit design while providing hands-on exposure to PCB layout, component selection, and thermal and safety considerations. Developing a board that safely converts a high-voltage battery input into multiple regulated rails strengthens skills in analyzing electrical requirements, implementing protection mechanisms, and validating designs through testing. This project offers meaningful insight into real-world engineering constraints and prepares the student for more advanced work in embedded systems and hardware development.
